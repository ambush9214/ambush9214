- Hello there, I'm Sam, I am currently a Personal Trainer who stubbled upon data analytics while looking for a career change. I have been a personal trainer for nearly a decade, and have a B.S. in Kinesiology with a focus in human performance.

- I became a personal trainer because I am passionate about educating others about how to improve their health and well being through exercise. 

- Once I started taking the Google Data Analytics Certification, I learned how engaging and challenging this field is; but it is also very rewarding.

- The Google Cert taught me the foundations of using multiple types of software. Such as, R programming, Big Query, Tableau, and excel/ google sheets.

- I then took it upon myself to learn more about MySQL and have found a course dedicated to that software and have really enjoyed learning to use MySQL. A few things that I learned in the MySQL course outside of cleaning and organizing data, is to take my time and really understand what I am being asked to do. I would read the question and rush to start my queries and would then have to read the question multiple times, when I could take notes and make sure I know what tools are being asked of me. 

- Outside of work I enjoy archery, gaming, and lifting weights (currently this is also while at work)...(lifting weights, not gaming or archery)....
